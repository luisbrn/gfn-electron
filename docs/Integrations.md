# Integrations

This document collects integration points (Discord, Flatpak, AUR badges) that users commonly ask about.

## Discord (Rich Presence)

Discord Rich Presence is optional and configurable. For detailed configuration and disabling instructions see `scripts/README.md#disabling-discord-rich-presence-rpc` (single source of truth).

If you want to disable Discord RPC entirely, set the environment variable `DISABLE_RPC=1` when launching the app.

## Packaging badges

The README header contains badges pointing at releases and coverage for this fork. Distribution packages such as Flatpak and AUR are community-maintained â€” check the package maintainer for support.
